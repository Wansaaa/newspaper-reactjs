This is a project written for the internship contest at VK. Around 10 hours total was 
spent on making this project from scratch.

I tried making this project as authentic as possible by using old school fonts and classic Win98 icons, 
replicating the style of Win98 with CSS.

Stuff used for this project:
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- React
- Redux
- React Router
